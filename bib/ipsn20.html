            Example of citing this paper:<br/>
            \cite{ipsn20-localization} introduces a multiple transmitter localization method, namely MAP_{*}, 
            that uses a hypotheses-based Bayesian approach in conjunction with a divide-and-conqure strategy to first localize "isolated" intruders and then localize the remaining intruders.<br/>
            \cite{ipsn20-localization} also introduces a novel spectrum interpolation method, namely ILDW, which interpolates an unknown RSSI at a location with the surrounding known RSSI values in the logarithm distance domain.
            Through simulations using data generated from SPLAT!, ILDW's interpolation error is significanly lower than IDW.
